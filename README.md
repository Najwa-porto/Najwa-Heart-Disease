[![🚀 Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](PASTE_YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using the **Heart Disease Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) with the **Random Forest** algorithm.  
It combines **bootstrap aggregating (bagging)** and **decision trees** to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview
- 🎯 **Objective**: Predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.
- 📂 **Dataset**: Heart Disease (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- 🌳 **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- 🛠 **Tools**: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🛠 Features
- 🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🌳 Model training using Random Forest Classifier  
- ✅ Model evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
- 🌿 Visualization of decision tree from the forest  

## 📊 Results
The model achieved **high accuracy** in predicting heart disease.  
The decision tree visualization shows **`oldpeak` (ST depression)** as one of the most influential features — higher ST depression values are associated with higher risk of heart disease.
